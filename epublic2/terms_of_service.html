    fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure

    unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
    CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY

            No Waiver. No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Dragdis's failure to

    and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). This means that the Sponsor must notify parents/guardians of the
    information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the Dragdis or through the Dragdis Services the
    personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the Dragdis Services. Schools may under appropriate
    circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission’s website
